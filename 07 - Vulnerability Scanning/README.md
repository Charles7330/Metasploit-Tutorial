# Vulnerability Scanning

- Metasploit allows you to quickly identify some critical vulnerabilities that could be considered as “low hanging fruit”.  

- The term “low hanging fruit” usually refers to ***easily identifiable and exploitable vulnerabilities*** that could potentially allow you to gain a foothold on a system and, in some cases, gain high-level privileges such as root or administrator.

- Finding vulnerabilities using Metasploit will rely heavily on your ability to scan and fingerprint the target. The better you are at these stages, the more options Metasploit may provide you. 

- For example, if you identify a ***VNC service*** running on the target, you may use the `search` function on Metasploit to list useful modules. The results will contain payload and post modules. 

- At this stage, these results are not very useful as we have not discovered a potential exploit to use just yet. However, in the case of VNC, there are several scanner modules that we can use.

- You can use the `info` command for any module to have a better understanding of its ***use*** and ***purpose***.

- As you can see, the `vnc_login` module can help us find login details for the ***VNC service***.
