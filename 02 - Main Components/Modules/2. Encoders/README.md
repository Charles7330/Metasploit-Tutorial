# Encoders

- Encoders will allow you to encode the exploit and payload in the hope that a ***signature-based*** antivirus solution may miss them.

- Signature-based antivirus and security solutions have a database of known threats. 
- They detect threats by comparing suspicious files to this database and raise an alert if there is a match. 
- Thus encoders can have a ***limited success rate*** as antivirus solutions can perform additional checks.
