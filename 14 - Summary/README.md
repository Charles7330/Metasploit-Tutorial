# What We Learnt ?

## Metasploit Introduction

- Metasploit is a powerful tool that facilitates the exploitation process. The exploitation process comprises three main steps; ***finding the exploit***, ***customizing the exploit***, and ***exploiting the vulnerable service***.

- Metasploit provides many modules that you can use for each step of the exploitation process. Through this repo, we have seen the basic components of Metasploit and their respective use.

- We also had used the `ms17_010_eternalblue` exploit to gain access to the target machine.

## Metasploit : Exploitation

- You should now have a better understanding of how Metasploit can help you identify potential vulnerabilities on target systems and exploit these vulnerabilities.

- You have also seen how the database feature can help you with penetration testing engagements where you have multiple potential targets.

- Finally, you should have gained some experience with msfvenom and the creation of stand-alone Meterpreter payloads. 

- This is especially helpful in situations where you can upload a file to the target system or have the ability to download files to the target system.

## Metasploit : Meterpreter

- Meterpreter is a powerful tool that offers a lot of easy to use features during the post-exploitation phase.
 
- We have seen how in-memory payloads can be used for post-exploitation.
