# Meterpreter Commands

- Typing `help` on any ***Meterpreter session*** (shown by `meterpreter>` at the prompt) will list all available commands.

- Every version of Meterpreter will have different command options, so running the help command is always a good idea. 

- Commands are ***built-in*** tools available on Meterpreter. They will run on the target system without loading any additional script or executable files.


- Meterpreter will provide you with `three primary` categories of tools;

   -  Built-in commands
   -  Meterpreter tools
   -  Meterpreter scripting

- If you run the help command, you will see Meterpreter commands are listed under different categories.

   -  Core commands
   -  File system commands
   -  Networking commands
   -  System commands
   -  User interface commands
   -  Webcam commands
   -  Audio output commands
   -  Elevate commands
   -  Password database commands
   -  Timestomp commands

- **<ins>Please note</ins>** that the list above was taken from the output of the help command on the Windows version of Meterpreter, `windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`. 

- These will be different for other Meterpreter versions.

**<ins>Although all these commands may seem available under the help menu, they may not all work. For example, the target system might not have a webcam, or it can be running on a virtual machine without a proper desktop environment</ins>**.
