# Post-Exploitation Challenge

### Room Link: Task 5 in https://tryhackme.com/room/meterpreter

- Meterpreter provides several important post-exploitation tools.
- Commands mentioned previously, such as `getsystem` and `hashdump` will provide important leverage and information for privilege escalation and lateral movement. 

- Meterpreter is also a good base you can use to run post-exploitation modules available on the Metasploit framework. 
- Finally, you can also use the `load` command to leverage additional tools such as `Kiwi` or even the whole `Python` language.

- The post-exploitation phase will have several goals; Meterpreter has functions that can assist all of them.

    - Gathering further information about the target system
    - Looking for interesting files, user credentials, additional network interfaces, and generally interesting information on the target system
    - Privilege escalation
    - Lateral movement

- Once any additional tool is loaded using the `load` command, you will see new options on the `help` menu. 

- The example below shows commands added for the `Kiwi` module (using the `load kiwi` command).

- These will change according to the loaded menu, so running the `help` command after loading a module is always a good idea.
