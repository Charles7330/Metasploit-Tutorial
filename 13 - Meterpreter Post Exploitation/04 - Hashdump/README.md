# Hashdump

- The `hashdump` command will list the content of the ***SAM database***. 

- The `SAM` (Security Account Manager) database stores user's passwords on Windows systems. 

- These passwords are stored in the `NTLM` (New Technology LAN Manager) format.

- While it is `not` mathematically possible to "crack" these hashes, you may still discover the cleartext password using online NTLM databases or a rainbow table attack. 

- These hashes can also be used in `Pass-the-Hash` attacks to authenticate to other systems that these users can access the same network.
