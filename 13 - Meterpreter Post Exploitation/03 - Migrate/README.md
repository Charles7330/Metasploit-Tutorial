# Migrate

- Migrating to another process will help Meterpreter interact with it. 

- For example, if you see a word processor running on the target (e.g. word.exe, notepad.exe, etc.), you can migrate to it and start capturing keystrokes sent by the user to this process. 

- Some Meterpreter versions will offer you the `keyscan_start`, `keyscan_stop`, and `keyscan_dump` command options to make Meterpreter act like a ***keylogger***. 

- Migrating to another process may also help you to have a more stable Meterpreter session.

- To migrate to any process, you need to type the `migrate` command followed by the `PID` of the desired target process. The example below shows Meterpreter migrating to process `ID 716`.

- **<ins>Be careful</ins>**; you may lose your user privileges if you migrate from a higher privileged (e.g. SYSTEM) user to a process started by a lower privileged user (e.g. webserver). You may **<ins>not be able</ins>** to gain them back.
