# Working With Exploit

- Metasploit is an exploitation framework. Exploits are the most populated module category. 

- You can search exploits using the `search` command, obtain more information about the exploit using the `info` command, and launch the exploit using `exploit`.

- While the process itself is simple, remember that a successful outcome depends on a thorough understanding of services running on the target system. 

- Most of the exploits will have a preset default payload. However, you can always use the `show payloads` command to list other commands you can use with that specific exploit.

- Once you have decided on the payload, you can use the `set payload` command to make your choice.

- Note that choosing a working payload could become a ***trial and error*** process due to environmental or OS restrictions such as firewall rules, anti-virus, file writing, or the program performing the payload execution isn't available (eg. `payload/python/shell_reverse_tcp`).
  
- Some payloads will open new parameters that you may need to set, running the `show options` command once more can show these. 

- As you can see in the above example, a reverse payload will at least require you to set the `LHOST` option.

- Once a session is opened, you can background it using `CTRL+Z` or abort it using `CTRL+C`. 

- ***Backgrounding a session*** will be useful when working on ***more than one*** target simultaneously or on the ***same target with a different exploit*** and/or shell.
