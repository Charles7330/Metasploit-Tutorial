# UDP Service Identification

- The ***scanner/discovery/udp_sweep*** module will allow you to quickly identify services running over the UDP (User Datagram Protocol). 

- As you can see below, this module will not conduct an extensive scan of all possible UDP services but does provide a quick way to identify services such as `DNS` or `NetBIOS`.
